            <h3>Object of the Game</h3>
            <p>The object of each player is to have their horse reach the finish line first. Winning players of each round divide the "pot" collected during the round. The game can be played with 2 to 6 plaayers but 4 to 6 players is best.</p>
            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The horsed are lined up at the starting line.</li>
                <li>The cards are shuffled are dealt to each player one at a time till this are no more cards. Playes take turns distrubuting the card at the start of each round.</li>
                <li>Each player take a turn to roll the dice to determine four "scratch" horses. These horses will not race.</li>
                <li>Each "scratch" horse will be places in the Scratch area. First horse in moved the first row, second horse to the second row, third horse to the third row and forth horse to the forth row. If a player rolls an number that ia already scratched the next take their turn until 4 different numbers are chosen.</li>
                <li>The players then will see their cards and will pay into the pot for each card they have in their hand, which represents a "scratch" horse determined by the row the horse is in. (For example, if the number 8 horse in in the first row, all players with a number eight card will pay 10 cents into the pot, if the number 2 horse is in the second row, all players with a number two card with pay 15 cents, which ever numbered horse is into third row, players having that numbered card will 20 cents and plays having the numbered card of the horse in the forth row wil pay 25 cents.) Those cards are then removed from the players hand. The only cards left should match to running horses.</li>
                <li>Each card is a player's "bet" on that horse and a share of the potif it wins.(For example, if the number 5 horse wins the race, anyone holding a number 5 card will split the pot with any other players hold a 5 card. If a player is holding more than one of the winning card number, they will recieve how over many shares are represented by the amount of winning number cards they have.) </li>
                <li>Starting with the player to left of the dealer, all players take turns rolling the dice once. If the player rolls the number to a "scratch" horse, the corrisponding amount is payed into the pot. If the number is that of a running horse then that horse moves up one spot. </li>
                <li>Players continue rolling until a horse reaches the finish line</li>
                <li>Players are out if they lose all their money</li>
            </ol>
